    """Interleavesound is a modified version of Interleavedscan with added sounding
    frequency data.

    Interleavedscan was requested in 2016 by Tomo Hori to support the ERG mission.
    On September 13th, 2016 Tomo and Evan sent emails to the darn-swg mailing list regarding
    this request. It was requested to run starting Nov 2016 with the launch of the ERG Japanese
    satellite. It interleaves the beam number, for example a 16-beam radar would proceed like:
    0-4-8-12 - 2-6-10-14 - 1-5-9-13 - 3-711-15 for the forward, and the reverse of that for the
    backward. They were looking to capture doppler velocity oscillations related to Pc3
    geomagnetic pulsations near the cusp."""
