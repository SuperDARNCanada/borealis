    On September 13th, 2016 Tomo and Evan sent emails to the darn-swg mailing list regarding
    this request. It was requested to run starting Nov 2016 with the launch of the ERG Japanese
    satellite. It interleaves the beam number, for example a 16-beam radar would proceed like:
    0-4-8-12 - 2-6-10-14 - 1-5-9-13 - 3-711-15 for the forward, and the reverse of that for the
    backward. They were looking to capture doppler velocity oscillations related to Pc3
    geomagnetic pulsations near the cusp."""
