# The first pulse in each sequence starts on the 0.1 second boundaries,
# to enable bistatic listening on other radars.
# This mode also chooses a frequency from another radar to listen in on,
# also across the entire FOV simultaneously.

    This experiment has different behaviour depending on the site that

    while RKN and PGR 'listen in' on CLY, therefore operating as separate
    bistatic systems with CLY. All sites run a widebeam mode that 
    receives (and transmits for some sites) the entire FOV simultaneously.
