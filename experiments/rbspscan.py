    """rbspscan was first run in 2012 to support the Van Allen probes satellite mission
    (initially called the RBSP mission or Radiation Belt Storm Probes). It had a trigger mode
    where the DST (Disturbance Storm Time) index would be checked every 30 minutes, and if it
    went below a threshold, then rbspscan would trigger for at least 30 minutes. This was
    implemented via a python script that would update the schedule file on the CDN radars. The
    scheduler for qnx4 was upgraded to allow this to happen. Both duration and priority of a
    particularly scheduled radar control program were capabilities added to the scheduler, so
    that a PI group could prioritize any discretionary time modes over rbspscan if they wanted to



    Tim Yeoman - Fri Sept 21st, 2012
    The proposed RBSP mode (in the first instance) is a follows:

    CT-TRIG
    An interleaved full scan and mini scan, giving 2 min full scan data for
    convection, as was done in the old common time. So it is essentially the
    Themis mode but with 3 camp beams, Standard lagfr and smsep, a 3 s dwell and
    2 min scan boundaries.

    So a mono beam pattern would go as follows for a forward scanning radar,
    where n is the meridional beam:

    0,n-1,1, n,2, n+2,3,n-1,4,n,5,n+2,6,n-1,7,n,8,n+2,9, ...

    A first suggestion for the mini-scan beam choices is attached, although
    individual PIs can change this if, for example, there is a key piece of
    other instrumentation in their f-o-v which they would like to cover.

    In the first instance, CT-TRIG and ST-APOG can be the same. The idea is
    that ST-APOG can have its lag to first range and range gate size adjusted to
    best match any apogee passes.
