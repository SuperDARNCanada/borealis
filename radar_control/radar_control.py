    radar_control process
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Radar_control is the process that runs the radar (sends pulses to the driver with
    timing information and sends processing information to the signal processing process).
    Experiment_handler provides the experiment for radar_control to run. It iterates
    through the scan_class_base objects to control the radar.
