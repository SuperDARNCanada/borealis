    ~~~~~
    This is the module containing the Scan class. The Scan class contains the
    ScanClassBase members, as well as a scanbound (to be implemented), a beamdir
    dictionary and scan_beams dictionary which specify beam direction angle and beam
    order in a scan, respectively, for individual slices that are to be combined in this
    scan. Beam direction information gets passed on to the AveragingPeriod.
