    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This is the module containing the AveragingPeriod class. The AveragingPeriod class
    contains the ScanClassBase members, as well as clrfrqflag (to be implemented),
    intn (number of integrations to run), or intt(max time for integrations),
    and it contains sequences of class Sequence.

""" Scans are made up of AveragingPeriods, these are typically a 3sec time of
the same pulse sequence pointing in one direction.  AveragingPeriods are made
up of Sequences, typically the same sequence run ave. 20-30 times after a clear
frequency search.  Sequences are made up of pulse_time lists, which give
timing, slice, and pulsenumber. CPObject provides channels, pulseshift (if
any), freq, pulse length, beamdir, and wavetype.

    Set up the AveragingPeriods.

    An averagingperiod contains sequences and integrates one or multiple pulse sequences
    together in a given time frame or in a given number of averages, if that is the
    preferred limiter.

    **The unique members of the averagingperiod are (not a member of the scanclassbase):**

    slice_to_beamorder
        passed in by the scan that this AveragingPeriod instance is contained in. A
        dictionary of slice: beam_order for all slices contained in this aveperiod.
    slice_to_beamdir
        passed in by the scan that this AveragingPeriod instance is contained in. A
        dictionary of slice: beamdir(s) for all slices contained in this aveperiod.
    clrfrqflag
        Boolean, True if clrfrqsearch should be performed.
    clrfrqrange
        The range of frequency to search if clrfrqflag is True.  Otherwise empty.
    intt
        The priority limitation. The time limit (ms) at which time the aveperiod will
        end. If None, we will use intn to end the aveperiod (a number of sequences).
    intn
        Number of averages (# of times the sequence transmits) to end after for the
        averagingperiod.
    sequences
        The list of sequences included in this aveperiod. This does not indicate how
        many averages will be transmitted in the aveperiod. If there are multiple
        sequences in the list, they will be alternated between until the end of the
        aveperiod.
    one_pulse_only
        boolean, True if this averaging period only has one unique set of pulse samples in it.
        This is true if there is only one sequence in the averaging period, and all pulses after the
        first pulse in the sequence have the isarepeat key = True. This boolean can be used to
        speed up the process of sending data to the driver which means we can get more averages
        in less time.
