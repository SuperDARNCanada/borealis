    This is the module containing the Sequence class. The Sequence class contains the
    ScanClassBase members, as well as a list of pulse dictionaries,
    the total_combined_pulses in the sequence, power_divider, last_pulse_len, ssdelay,
    seqtime, which together give sstime (scope synce time, or time for receiving,
    and numberofreceivesamples to sample during the receiving window (calculated using
    the receive sampling rate).

    Set up the sequence class.

    **The members of the sequence are:**

    ssdelay
        delay past the end of the sequence to receive for (us) - function of num_ranges and
        pulse_len. ss stands for scope sync.
    seqtime
        the amount of time for the whole sequence to transmit, until the logic signal
        switches low on the last pulse in the sequence (us).
    sstime
        ssdelay + seqtime (total time for receiving) (us).
    numberofreceivesamples
        the number of receive samples to take, given the rx rate, during
        the sstime.
    first_rx_sample_start
        The location of the first sample for the RX data from the start of the TX data (in number
        of samples, unitless). This will be calculated as the center sample of the first
        occurring pulse (uncombined).
    blanks
        A list of sample indices that should not be used for acfs because they were samples
        taken when transmitting.
    basic_slice_pulses
        A dictionary that holds pre-computed tx samples for each slice. Each dictionary value is a
        multi-dimensional array that holds a beamformed set of samples for each antenna for all
        beam directions.
    combined_pulses_metadata
        This list holds dictionary metadata for all pulses in the sequence. This metadata holds all
        the info needed to combine pulses if pulses are mixed.
            start_time_us - start time of the pulse in us, relative to the first pulse in sqn.
            total_pulse_len - total length of the pulse that includes len of all combined pulses.
            pulse_sample_start - The tx sample number at which the pulse starts.
            tr_window_num_samps - The number of tx samples of the tr window.
            component_info - a list of all the pre-combined pulse components
                        (incl their length and start time) that are in the combined pulseAlso in us.
            pulse_transmit_data - dictionary hold the transmit metadata that will be sent to driver.
    output_encodings
        This dict will hold a list of all the encodings used during an aveperiod for each slice.
        These will be used for data write later.
