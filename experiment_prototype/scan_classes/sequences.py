    This is the module containing the Sequence class. The Sequence class contains the
    ScanClassBase members, as well as a list of pulse dictionaries,
    the total_combined_pulses in the sequence, power_divider, last_pulse_len, ssdelay,
    seqtime, which together give sstime (scope synce time, or time for receiving,
    and numberofreceivesamples to sample during the receiving window (calculated using
    the receive sampling rate).

    Set up the sequence class.

    **The members of the sequence are:**

    pulses
        a list of pre-combined, pre-sampled pulse dictionaries (one dictionary = one
        basic pulse of single frequency). The dictionary keys are: isarepeat,
        pulse_timing_us, slice_id, slice_pulse_index, pulse_len,
        intra_pulse_start_time, combined_pulse_index, pulse_shift, iscombined,
        combine_total, and combine_index.
    total_combined_pulses
        the total number of pulses to be sent by the driver. This may not
        be the sum of pulses in all slices in the sequence, as some pulses may need to be
        combined because they are overlapping in timing. This is the number of pulses in the
        combined sequence, or the number of times T/R signal goes high in the sequence.
    power_divider
        the power ratio per slice. If there are multiple slices in the same
        pulse then we must reduce the output amplitude to potentially accommodate multiple
        frequencies.
    last_pulse_len
        the length of the last pulse (us)
    ssdelay
        delay past the end of the sequence to receive for (us) - function of num_ranges and
        pulse_len. ss stands for scope sync.
    seqtime
        the amount of time for the whole sequence to transmit, until the logic signal
        switches low on the last pulse in the sequence (us).
    sstime
        ssdelay + seqtime (total time for receiving) (us).
    numberofreceivesamples
        the number of receive samples to take, given the rx rate, during
        the sstime.
    first_rx_sample_time
        The location of the first sample for the RX data, in time, from the start of the TX data.
        This will be calculated as the time at center sample of the first pulse. In seconds.
    blanks
        A list of sample indices that should not be used for acfs because they were samples
        taken when transmitting.

    **Pulses is a list of pulse dictionaries. The pulse dictionary keys are:**

    isarepeat
        Boolean, True if the pulse is exactly the same as the last pulse in the sequence.
    pulse_timing_us
        The time past the start of sequence for this pulse to start at (us).
    slice_id
        The slice_id that corresponds to this pulse and gives the information about the
        experiment and pulse information (frequency, num_ranges, first_range, etc.).
    slice_pulse_index
        The index of the pulse in its own slice's sequence.
    pulse_len
        The length of the pulse (us)
    intra_pulse_start_time
        If the pulse is combined with another pulse and they transmit in a single USRP
        burst, then we need to know if there is an offset from one pulse's samples being
        sent and the other pulse's samples being sent.
    combined_pulse_index
        The combined_pulse_index is the index corresponding with actual number of pulses
        that will be sent to driver, after combinations are completed. Multiple pulse
        dictionaries in self.pulses can have the same combined_pulse_index if they are
        combined together, ie are close enough in timing that T/R will not go low
        between them, and we will combine the samples of both pulses into one set to
        send to the driver.
    pulse_shift
        Phase shift for this pulse, for doing pulse coding.
    iscombined
        Boolean, true if there is another pulse with the same combined_pulse_index.
    combine_total
        Total number of pulse dictionaries that have the same combined_pulse_index as
        this one. (minimum number = 1, itself).
    combine_index
        Index of this pulse dictionary in regards to all the other pulse dictionaries that
        have the same combined_pulse_index.
