antennas_iq v0.6
================

This is the most up to date version of this file format produced by Borealis version 0.6, the current version.

For data files from previous Borealis software versions, see `here <https://borealis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/borealis_data.html#previous-versions>`_.

The pyDARNio format class for this format is BorealisAntennasIq found in the `borealis_formats <https://github.com/SuperDARN/pyDARNio/blob/master/pydarnio/borealis/borealis_formats.py>`_.

The antennas_iq format is intended to hold individual antennas I and Q data. The data is filtered, but is not averaged. 

Both site files and array-restructured files exist for this file type. Both are described below.

-----------------------
antennas_iq array files
-----------------------

Array restructured files are produced after the radar has finished writing a file and contain record data in multi-dimensional arrays so as to avoid repeated values, shorten the read time, and improve human readability. Fields that are unique to the record are written as arrays where the first dimension is equal to the number of records recorded. Other fields that are unique to the slice or experiment (and are therefore repeated for all records) are written only once. 

The group names in these files are the field names themselves, greatly reducing the number of group names in the file when compared to site files and making the file much more human readable.

The naming convention of the antennas_iq array-structured files are:

[YYYYmmDD].[HHMM].[SS].[station_id].[slice_id].antennas_iq.hdf5

For example: 20191105.1400.02.sas.0.antennas_iq.hdf5

This is the file that began writing at 14:00:02 UT on November 5 2019 at the Saskatoon site, and it provides data for slice 0 of the experiment that ran at that time. It has been array restructured because it does not have a .site designation at the end of the filename.

These files are zlib compressed which is native to hdf5 and no decompression is necessary before reading using your hdf5 library. 

The file fields in the antennas_iq array files are:

| |                                 | | The num_beams field should be used to     |
| |                                 | | read the correct number of beams for each |
| |                                 | | record.                                   |

antennas_iq site files
----------------------

Site files are produced by the Borealis code package and have the data in a record by record style format. In site files, the hdf5 group names (ie record names) are given as the timestamp in ms past epoch of the first sequence or sampling period recorded in the record. 

The naming convention of the antennas_iq site-structured files are:

[YYYYmmDD].[HHMM].[SS].[station_id].[slice_id].antennas_iq.hdf5.site

For example: 20191105.1400.02.sas.0.antennas_iq.hdf5.site
This is the file that began writing at 14:00:02 UT on November 5 2019 at the Saskatoon site, and it provides data for slice 0 of the experiment that ran at that time. 

These files are often bzipped after they are produced.

The file fields under the record name in antennas_iq site files are:

Site/Array Restructuring
------------------------

File restructuring to array files is done using an additional code package. Currently, this code is housed within `pyDARNio <https://github.com/SuperDARN/pyDARNio>`_.

The site to array file restructuring occurs in the borealis BaseFormat _site_to_array class method, and array to site restructuring is done in the same class _array_to_site method. Both can be found `here <https://github.com/SuperDARN/pyDARNio/blob/master/pydarnio/borealis/borealis_formats.py>`_.
