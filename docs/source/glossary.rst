Glossary
========

array
	In SuperDARN data, the array data refers to the 
	data after it has been beamformed and all antennas are 
	combined into one array dataset. Typically the SuperDARN 
	antennas are divided into the main antenna array and one
	interferometer antenna array. 

averaging period
	A time during which sequences are transmitted repeatedly
	with the intent to average the received samples together.
	Averaging period is often used interchangeably with
	integration time. 

channel
	This term is often used to denote frequency channels, 
	but in USRPs it is also often used to denote the different
	transmit and receive physical ports, in which case for 
	SuperDARN the different USRP channels would denote 
	different antennas. We have tried to avoid the use of this
	term due to the ambiguity.

device
	When using Ettus UHD API this refers to the
	radio devices, or the N200s in the case of Borealis.
	When in the context of CUDA, this refers to the GPU.


integration time
	The time allocated for an averaging period. An averaging
	period can be defined by the integration time (during which 
	as many sequences as possible are transmitted); or simply
	by the number of sequences to transmit for the averaging
	period. Integration time is often used interchangeably with
	averaging period. 

host
	A local machine; for Borealis this is the Borealis computer.

nave
	number of averages; equivalent to number of sequences 
	transmitted or number of sampling periods received.

record
	A recorded subset of data. In SuperDARN data, a record 
	contains all data for an integration time, and in the 
	rawacf data the data is already averaged from the 
	integration time.

sampling period
	The receive sampling time allocated to a transmitted 
	sequence.

sequence
	A pulse sequence to be transmitted. Each sequence has 
	a sampling period, which extends past the length of 
	the pulse sequence for some time dependent on the 
	number of ranges to be sampled.
