experiments package
===================

This is where you would create your experiment that you would like to run on the
radar. The following are a couple of examples of current SuperDARN experiments, and a
brief discussion of the `update()` method which will be implemented at a later date.

experiments.normalscan module
-----------------------------

Normalscan is a very common experiment for SuperDARN. It does not update itself, so
no `update()` method is necessary. It only has a single slice, as there is only one
frequency, pulse_len, beam_order, etc. Since there is only one slice there is no need
for an interface dictionary.

    :linenos:

experiments.twofsound module
----------------------------

Twofsound is a common variant of the normalscan experiment for SuperDARN. It does not
update itself, so no `update()` method is necessary. It has two frequencies so will
require two slices. The frequencies switch after a full scan (full cycle through the
beams), therefore the interfacing between slices 0 and 1 should be 'SCAN'.
