Realtime Package
================

The realtime package contains the utilities that check data files for corruption during operation and serving the data
to external sockets.

This module also handles the removal of temporary files generated during radar operation. Temporary files are generated
every sequence and copied into their respective two hour file. The path to the temporary file is passed from data_write
to realtime, which realtime uses to check the file integrity and serve the data.

This module is required to operate the radar. Without it, the system will slow as the number of temporary files
increases.
