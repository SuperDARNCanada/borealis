Realtime Package
================

The realtime package contains the utilities that check data files for corruption during operation
and serving the data to external sockets.

Additional data processing is done using a Python package called ``backscatter``, which is an implementation of the
standard FITACF3 algorithm for analyzing SuperDARN data. More details about this package can be found at its GitHub
`homepage <https://github.com/SuperDARNCanada/backscatter>`_.
