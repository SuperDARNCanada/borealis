Simultaneous Full Field-of-View Imaging
=======================================

Simultaneous Full Field-of-View (FOV) Imaging is now possible with Borealis! The current implementation
uses phase modulation across the transmitting antennas of the main array. Two configurations are supported
right now: transmission with all 16 main antennas, and transmission with 8 adjacent antennas of the main array.
These two modes are implemented in the experiments `full_fov.py` and `full_fov_2freq.py`, respectively, with
the latter using 8 antennas for each of two frequencies which transmit simultaneously.

To create your own Full FOV experiment using 8- or 16-antenna phase modulation, a utility function is present
in `superdarn_common_fields.py`. To use this function, set::

    slice_dict['tx_antenna_pattern'] = scf.easy_widebeam

in your experiment slice dictionary.

More generally, you can define your own power- and phase-modulation across the transmitting antennas.
Define a function with the following signature::

    def fn_name(frequency_khz, tx_antennas, antenna_spacing_m):
        """Defines the power and phase modulation for each transmitting antenna.

        Parameters
        ----------
        frequency_khz: int
            Frequency in kHz.
        tx_antennas: list
            List of transmitting antennas for the slice.
        antenna_spacing_m: float
            Spacing between adjacent antennas in the main array, in meters.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray of shape (num_beams, num_main_antennas).
        Each element should be a complex number with magnitude <= 1.0 defining the power and phase for that antenna.
        """

Then, assign the function to ``tx_antenna_pattern`` in your slice dictionary.
It is important that the first dimension of the returned array matches the first dimension of ``rx_beam_order`` in your
slice dictionary, and that ``num_main_antennas`` matches the number of main antennas in the config file.

Bistatic Experiments
====================

Bistatic experiments are now supported in Borealis. A multi-purpose bistatic experiment is defined in
`bistatic_test.py`, and can be used at both transmitting and receiving radar sites. This experiment uses
command-line arguments to control its behaviour, making it flexible and configurable.

By default, the `bistatic_test` experiment will transmit a full FOV pattern like `full_fov.py` on a single frequency.
To operate a radar in a bistatic listening mode, the argument ``listen_to=[three-letter radar code]`` must be passed
to the experiment handler via `steamed_hams.py`. This will look something like this::

    radar@borealis~$ ./steamed_hams.py bistatic_test release discretionary --kwargs_string "listen_to=rkn"

This invocation will trigger the radar to receive only, tuning to common-mode frequency 1 for RKN defined in
`superdarn_common_fields.py`. Additionally, it will trigger an imaging mode, receiving signals on all 16 beams
simultaneously. If the listening radar specified is the same as the radar that you are running the experiment on,
the experiment will default to a listening-only mode on the radar's common-mode frequency 1.

For further control over the transmitting characteristics, an additional keyword argument `beam_order` is supported.
This controls the `tx_beam_order` field of the slice dictionary, and allows for traditional beams to be used.
The `beam_order` value must be formatted as a list of numbers, such as `0,1,2,3-5,2,9`, with ranges
being parsed to include all numbers in between and both endpoints. Therefore, for this example, beams used would be
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2 and finally 9. Repeated beams are valid.

The arguments `beam_order` and `listen_to` are mutually exclusive.

You can define your own bistatic experiment, with very few restrictions. It is highly recommended that
the field `align_sequences` is set to `True` in your experiment slice dictionary, which will send out the first
pulse in each sequence within 1us of each 0.1 second boundary. Without this field set in the experiments of both radars
in the bistatic link, there is no guarantee of timing synchronicity and the data will likely be useless.
Additionally, it is recommended that the experiments running at both the transmit and receive radars are
both using the same scanbound. This will make it much easier to compare data from the transmit and recieve
sites as the averaging periods should line up exactly. Lastly, it is recommended that you check the data files
for both radars afterwards and ensure that the `gps_locked` flag is True for all times. If not, the clock may have
drifted, and the `sqn_timestamps` field may be inaccurate.
