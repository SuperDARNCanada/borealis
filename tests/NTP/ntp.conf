# This is the ntpd configuration file and is typically located at /etc/ntp.conf
# When ntpd is started, there is a command line flag to choose where to look for this file.

# The NTP driftfile is used by ntpd to store the frequency offset that would be required for the
# system clock to match UTC. It is specified in PPM (parts per million). a value of 1 would
# indicate that NTP thinks the system clock has a 1PPM offset in frequency from true time.
# This would mean the clock drifts (if not corrected for by ntpd) 1 microsecond per second, or
# 3600 us per hour or 86400 us per day.
